colemak.vim
===========

This set of remappings adjusts Vim to work with the Colemak keyboard layout.

It started out as a copy of [Shai Coleman's colemak.vim][1] but quickly
changed when I realized that while some of his ideas were interesting, others
I didn't like at all.

The **colemak.vim** file has changed over the years to suit me and my
needs/preferences; changes are still introduced from time to time.  
This means that it most likely isn't suitable for someone who's looking for
a "faithful translation of QWERTY Vim"; this isn't an attempt to do that.
